% Epoch & Unix Timestamp Converter
%
%   Definition: Converts an epoch/unix timestamp into a human readable date
%               Output is both a vector of [Y, M, D, H, MN, S] saved in
%               "dv" and a standard date (e.g., 04-Oct-2017 20:00:30) 
%               saved in "y"
%
%   Syntax: [y, dv] = epoch2UTC(epoch)
